            <p><strong>Family Guy</strong> is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois, their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie, and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian.</p>
            
            <p>The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.</p>

            Since then, Family Guy has become a cultural phenomenon with a dedicated fan base.</p>
